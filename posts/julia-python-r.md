# Julia, Python and R compared *(draft)*

This post contains some comparison notes between these three languages.

## Performance using packages and running code

Summary: Julia has a performance edge when doing slightly larger computations for which R or Python don't have an optimized library already available.

Using a package requires loading it in a script, and running it.
* Julia is slower when _loading a package_ in a script than Python or R. Similarly _running a piece of code for the first time_ is slower. This difference comes from the fact that Julia does precompiling at this stage.
* When _executing code_ Julia is faster than Python or R because it is compiled to native code. When Python or R call code implemented in a package that's compiled to native code, the speeds are similar.

An example task was performed and benchmarked: calculating the simple moving average for a dataframe column containing 1,000,000 samples from the standard normal distribution.
* Python needed 0.70 seconds to import packages and run the task.
* Python needed 28 ms to run the task directly via Numpy and up to 6.03 seconds when using a custom function calling the Numpy function. This can be accelerated to 202 ms using Numba.
* Julia needed 9.0 seconds to import packages and run the task.
* Julia needed 14 ms to run the task.
