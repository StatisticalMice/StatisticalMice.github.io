# Julia, Python and R compared *(draft)*

This post contains some comparison notes between these three languages.

## Performance using packages and running code

Using a package requires installing it, loading it in a script, and running it.
* Python and R are somewhat slower than Julia when _installing packages_. Python and R use it for compiling and Julia for precompiling.
* Julia is much slower when _loading a package_ in a script than Python or R. Similarly _running a piece of code for the first time_ is much slower. This difference comes from the fact that Julia does more precompiling at this stage.
* When _executing code_ Julia is much faster than Python or R because it is compiled to native code. When Python or R call code implemented in a package that's compiled to native code, the speeds are similar.

Summary: Julia has a performance edge when doing slightly larger computations for which R or Python don't have an optimized library already available.
