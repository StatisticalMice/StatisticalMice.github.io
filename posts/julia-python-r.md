# Julia, Python and R compared *(draft)*

This post contains some comparison notes between these three languages.

## Performance using packages and running code

* Julia is slower than Python or R when loading packages in a script or during initial running of functions due to precompiling.
* When _executing code_ Julia is faster than Python or R because it is compiled to native code. When Python or R call code implemented in a package that's compiled to native code, the speeds are similar.

An example task is detailed on the following page: [Simple moving average speed comparison in Julia, Python and R](/posts/simple-moving-average-comparison)
